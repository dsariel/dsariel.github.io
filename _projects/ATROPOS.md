Currently, our CI/CD pipeline uses Zuul CI and Jenkins CI to run tests and report results to ReportPortal, ELK, or ZJB. However, monitoring of problems reported to these platforms requires tedious triaging and can lead to delays in issue resolution. We aim to address this by creating an automated system that monitors failures, cross-examines them against existing Jira tickets, and takes appropriate actions based on the findings.
