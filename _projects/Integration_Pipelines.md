The aim of this activity is to develop, monitor, and improve:

1. **Integration Pipelines Based on Reference Architectures**  
   Integration pipelines are created and maintained based on established reference architectures. More details can be found in the [OpenStack K8s Operators Architecture](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/architecture).

2. **Update Flows**  
   Ensuring seamless update processes, such as upgrading from the latest OSP 17 to the latest RHOSO 18.

3. **Adoption Flows**  
   Facilitating adoption flows, such as transitioning from RHOSO 18.1 to 18.2. More details on data plane adoption can be found [here](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/data-plane-adoption/).
